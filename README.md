### <span class="c2">Functionality</span>

<span>Note that project descriptions are very brief and deliberately underspecified. &nbsp;This is your chance for creativity. &nbsp;Begin with a set of possible features, plan according to the available time, and build something interesting. &nbsp;Think of the project not as a finished application, but as a proof-of-concept, prototype, or </span>

### <span class="c2">Working with other teams</span>

<span class="c0">You may discuss your project and the technologies you are using with other teams, but each team must build its own application and submit its own work.</span>

### <span class="c2">Working with members of your team</span>

<span class="c0">In general, each student in a group will receive the same grade. &nbsp;If you run into issues with your teammates, it is your responsibility to attempt to resolve them.</span>

<span class="c0">If you are unable to work with a member of your team (for example, if they disappear and fail to respond to attempts to contact them), bring the problem to my attention as soon as possible -- do not wait until the due date.</span>

### <span class="c2">Presentations</span>

<span class="c0">On presentation day, give a short demonstration of your application to the class. &nbsp;Include both functionality and implementation details. &nbsp;Your entire team must be present and available to answer questions, but you may designate individual team members to deliver the presentation.</span>

### <span class="c2">Grading</span>

<span class="c0">Each of the following factors contributes up to 3 points to the final grade for the project:</span>

1. <span class="c0">Quality of the presentation</span>

2. <span class="c0">Completeness of the presentation</span>

3. <span class="c0">Quality of documentation for installation and configuration</span>

4. <span class="c0">Quality of documentation for users</span>

5. <span class="c0">Project functionality</span>

6. <span class="c0">Project scope</span>

7. <span class="c0">Code quality</span>

8. <span class="c0">Code maintainability</span>

9. <span class="c0">Appropriate use of available technologies</span>

10. <span class="c0">Innovation</span>

11. <span class="c0">Web design</span>

12. <span class="c0">Teamwork &nbsp;</span>
